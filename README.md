# SudokuSolver
A simple sudoku solver in Java. Uses either a brute force-ish backtracking algorithm as well as a genetic algorithm.

## Input
The first line contains the number of puzzles to solve. After that, each puzzle has the unsolved version on one line without spaces (row by row) and the solution in the line below it in the same format. Empty spaces are represented by zeroes. For an example see input.txt.
